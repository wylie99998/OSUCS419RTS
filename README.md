#### Web1: RTS HTML5 Real-Time Strategy Game

---

GOT is a RTS RPG game where a user can form allies (and also enemies) in order
to rule Westeros. Due to the extravagant nature of GOT, they are a variety of
trivia question based on the seven kingdoms in Westeros and how the user answers
these questions along with their other allies will determine if the kingdom
will join them or not. Although there is a large fandom, there is a range of
knowledge between each fan which is why there will be three levels a user can
play.

## Running application
    Make sure recent version of Node.js is installed.
    IMPORTANT: Copy folder build/assets to Desktop. After executing npm start
    copy the assets back over to the build folder. If you don't do this, all
    sprites and images will be deleted and there will be errors. I still need
    edit the gulpfile.js so that it doesn't delete these files.
    - git clone https://github.com/wylie99998/OSUCS419RTS
